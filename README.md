# Sorting Algorithms
 Implementation of sorting algorithms in java and some fun play with them
 
 ## Currently it compares time taken for each technique to sort a random generated array and then prints the comparison
 ## As the length of array increases, how BubbleSort compare to QuickSort, It can be guessed from their execution time difference
 
 
 some sample results
 
 Lenght of Array | #Bubble Sort | #Selection Sort | #Insertion Sort| #Shell Sort | #Merge Sort | #Quick Sort
